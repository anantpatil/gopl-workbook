REST.
    
    Basic commands and respective actions:
    ---
    GET         /               list/retrieve all items
    GET         /x/id           retrieve item of type x with id
    POST        /x              create item of type x
    PUT         /x/id           update item of type x with id
    DELETE      /x/id           delete an item of type x with id


    About REST
    ----
    <I>
    Resource based.
    Noun based not action or verb based.
    URIs identify the resource.
    Multiple URIs may refer to same resource.
    Representations are separate from resources.
        JSON, CSV etc representations of resource person.
        Could be partial or full representation.
    HTTP action is used to command what action needs to be taken on the
    resource.

    <II>
    Representations of resource is used for communication between
    servers/components.
    Representation is how resources get manipulated.
    Part of resource state or entire resource object.
    Typically, JSON or XML.
    Example:
        Resource: Person
        Service: contact information (GET)
        Representation:
            name, address, phone number
            JSON or XML format

    <III>
    Six constraints apply to REST architecture:
        Client Server
        Stateless
        Cacheable
        Uniform interface: define interface between client and server
                           URIs for resources, HTTP stack for actions
                           Irrespective how many components are there or
                           how many layers, there is uniformity in
                           interface used for communication.
